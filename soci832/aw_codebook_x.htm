<b>This is a simulated dataset. It is not real empirical data. It is simulated from real empirical data</b>
<br><br>
This dataset is simulated from the dataset used in Study 1 of:

Harrigan, N. M., Koh, C. Y., & Amirrudin, A. (2017).  Threat of deportation as proximal social determinant of mental health amongst migrant workers. <i>Journal of immigrant and minority health, 19</i>(3), 511-522.
<br><br>
A simulated dataset is provided so as to protect the privacy of participants.
<br><br>
The text from the methods section of Harrigan, Koh, and Amirrudin (2017) paper is reproduced below, and from this it should be possible to understand the meaning of most variables in the dataset.
<br><br>
<b>Method</b> <br>
Study 1 was conducted in August 2013 within the “Little India” district of Singapore, a space that is commonly populated by South Asian migrant workers. There were three data collection locations: the first two locations were soup kitchens/meal centres and the third location was the streets of Little India. The soup kitchens are organised by a local non-governmental organisation (NGO), Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2). TWC2 offers free meals to migrant workers who have made injury or salary claims to the MOM. This programme is called ‘The Cuff Road Project’ (TCRP). From the first two locations, we surveyed 341 ‘claimant workers’ (migrant workers who had filed a salary dispute and/or workplace injury claim with MOM); while at the third location, we surveyed another 241 ‘ordinary’ migrant workers. Data collection spanned over a period of two weeks. 
<br><br>
The survey was fixed response survey designed in consultation with volunteers from TWC2, and was 39 questions long. The survey was translated into both Bengali and Tamil and checked by blind back translation. The survey was conducted by 50 volunteers, most of whom were students from our University. Volunteers were given a training manual and also received training by the study authors. Much of this training was done one-to-one. Upon completion of the survey, migrant workers were given two bars of soap.
<br><br>
The university’s Institutional Review Board (IRB) had approved the study prior to data collection. Informed consent was obtained from all participants included in the study.
<br><br>
<b>Instruments.</b> <br>
The instrument, used to measure psychological distress, is the Kessler 6 (K6) [34]. This six item questionnaire is a screening scale for serious mental illness (SMI) developed and thoroughly tested within the World Health Organization (WHO) World Mental Health (WMH) surveys  [35].
<br><br>
The K6 is a brief (2-3 minutes) yet sensitive screening scale for non-specific psychological distress in adults. Respondents answer six items rated on a 5-point scale, ranging from “none of the time” (value = 0) to “all of the time” (value = 4). Responses to the six questions are added to give a score from 0 to 24. For the purpose of analysis, we transform the K6 score into a predicted prevalence of Serious Mental Illness (SMI) by dichotomising the score, with a cut off of 13 and above. According to Kessler, et al. “[t]he definition of SMI stipulated in PL 102-321 requires the person to have at least one 12-month DSM disorder, other than a substance use disorder, and to have "serious impairment".” [34].
<br><br>
The K6 scale has been calibrated against the SMI diagnostic criteria, and thus the K6 scale can be used as a screening tool for SMI. Specifically, someone is likely to have an SMI if their K6 score is 13 or above [34]. In 2013, it was estimated that 4.2% of the U.S. population had an SMI [36].
<br><br>
Most of the independent variables in our models are self-explanatory. K6 ranges from 0 to 24. SMI is binary, with 1 representing the likely presence of serious mental illness. Age is measured in years. Married and Children are both binary, and when summed together they create the variable   dependents, which ranges from 0 to 2. Salary is measured in USD$100s. Hours/wk refers to number of hours worked per week, excluding breaks. >70hrs/wk is a binary variable, is 1 if the worker worked more than 70 hours per week, which we take as a normative indicator of excessive working hours. Construction is 1 if the respondent was working in the construction industry. Nationality is measured with dummy variables for Bangladeshi, Indian, and other (less that 1%). In all our models nationality is measured with variable Bangladeshi, with Indian and other nationalities as a combined reference category. Uncleared agent fee is 1 if the respondent indicated that they had a paid an agent fee, but had not yet repaid the debt associated with it. Injury dispute is 1 if the respondent had an injury dispute registered with MOM. Salary dispute (only) is 1 if they had a salary dispute registered with MOM, but did not have an injury claim registered. ‘Both injury and salary dispute’ is 1 if the worker had both an injury and salary dispute. Time since injury (yrs) is a continuous measure of time since injury, measured in years. This variable is 0 if the worker had no injury or only had a salary dispute. ‘Rent paid by employer (not runaway)’ is 1 if respondent indicated that their employer provided their accommodation or paid their rent. This was a measure which indicated that the worker had not run away from their employer. ‘Work Permit (not Special Pass)’ is 1 if the workers’ employer had not cancelled their Work Permit. Not having a Work Permit generally meant the worker was on a Special Pass. Threatened with deportation is 1 if the respondent answered yes to the question “Has your boss threatened to send you home?” 
<br><br>
<b>Statistics. </b> <br>
After data collection and entry was completed, 23 respondents (from an initial pool of 605) were removed because their estimated hourly rate of pay (> SGD$11.63/hr) suggested that they were not Work Permit holders (monthly regular salary SGD$2,200 and below), but in fact a higher visa class (SPass holders). Note that additional modelling was run with inclusion of these respondents and there was no difference between these models and those reported in this paper.
<br><br>
After data collection, input, and cleaning, a total of 1.2% of missing values were estimated using SPSS’s default multiple imputation routine. The pooled values for models of ten imputed datasets are presented. Note that all models were also run with non-imputed dataset, with listwise deletion, and there was no substantive change to any of the results.
<br><br>
We modelled the data using logistic regression analysis, with models for Serious Mental Illness, salary claim, injury claim, and threat of deportation. We then assembled the significant parameters of this analysis into a path diagram.
